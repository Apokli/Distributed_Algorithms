# Generate Environment
```bash
python3 ./generate_environment.py n   # n for the number of nodes
python3 ./generate_test_case.py n     # n for the number of nodes
```

# Run
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

# Test Cases explained
The test cases are generated by randomly shuffling 10 "give money" events, 5 "greetings" events, and 1 "initiate record" event.
The "initiate record" event will occur in one of the nodes.
Other event has random sources and random targets.

For example:
```bash
test_events = [
{
    3: "Give 559 to 1",
    6: "Give 447 to 2",
    10: "How are you doing! 1",
    12: "Give 431 to 1",
},
{
    1: "How are you doing! 2",
    2: "Give 724 to 2",
    3: "Give 294 to 0",
    7: "Initiate Record",
    9: "Give 432 to 0",
    12: "Give 872 to 2",
    14: "Give 114 to 2",
    17: "How are you doing! 2",
    21: "Give 984 to 0",
},
{
    2: "How are you doing! 1",
    6: "How are you doing! 0",
    9: "Give 524 to 0",
},
]
