# Generate Environment
```bash
python3 ./generate_environment.py n   # n for the number of nodes
python3 ./generate_test_case.py n     # n for the number of nodes
```

# Run
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

# Test Cases explained
The test cases are generated by randomly assigning letters from 'a' to 'z' to different nodes.
Each letter assigned is also planned to be broadcasted at randomly different time.

For example:
```bash
test_events = [
{
    2: 'a',
    6: 'b',
    9: 'c',
    11: 'g',
    12: 'k',
    13: 'n',
    17: 'o',
    20: 'r',
    22: 'v',
    24: 'z',
},
{
    4: 'd',
    8: 'e',
    10: 'h',
    12: 'i',
    15: 'j',
    17: 'm',
    19: 'p',
    20: 't',
    24: 'u',
    27: 'y',
},
{
    3: 'f',
    7: 'l',
    10: 'q',
    13: 's',
    15: 'w',
    17: 'x',
},
]
```
means that there are three nodes and node0 is assigned to broadcast abcgknorvz in order after 2,6... random delays respectively.
